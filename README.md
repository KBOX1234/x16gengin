This is an open-source project to make programming games for the commander X16 easier <br>
## !This project is still in development!<br>
This Game Engine is programmed in C because of the X16's 8mhz CPU (as opposed to the 1-2 mhz typical of this CPU)<br>
This allows for the use of higher-level languages such as C or Rust.<br>
OF course, it would probably be better to use inline assembly but C us funner so if someone wants to branch this, go ahead.
