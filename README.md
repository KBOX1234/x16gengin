# x16gengin
This is an open-source project to make programming games for the commander X16 easier <br>
##!This project is still in development!
This Game Engine is programmed in C because of the X16's 8mhz CPU (as opposed to the 1-2 mhz typical of this CPU)
This allows for the use of higher-level languages such as C or rust.
OF corse it would probubly be better for this to use inline assembly but C us funner so if someone wants to branch this, go ahead.
